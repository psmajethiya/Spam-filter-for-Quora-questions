## Quora Spam Classifier

This project builds a binary text classification model to detect whether a Quora question is spam or not. The model was trained using a deep learning architecture combining LSTM and Bidirectional GRU layers, with GloVe embeddings to represent words in semantic space.

### Files
- `quora_spam_classifier.ipynb`: Main notebook with training and evaluation
- `quora_spam_model.h5`: the trained model is available in this drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ILDxigcH4r-g1bbv5MprwDMF36IOhEi?usp=drive_link

###Word Embeddings
The model uses **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)** â€” specifically the `glove.6B.100d.txt` pretrained embeddings (100-dimensional). This file was not uploaded due to size constraints but can be [downloaded from the official source](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
